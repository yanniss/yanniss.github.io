    <h1>History of the J-Orchestra Project</h1>
    </center>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left">J-Orchestra is a research project that is taking place in
      the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu">College of Computing</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia
      Institute of Technology</a>.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">In the Fall of 2000, <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/"> Yannis</a>  
      suggested to <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~tilevich/"> Eli</a> to have a look at the
      <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/sn/millennium/coign.aspx" target="_blank">Coign
      </a> 
      system.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">After reading about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/sn/millennium/coign.aspx" target="_blank">Coign,</a>
      Eli decided to start looking at the possibilities of building a 
      similar automatic partitioning system for the Java platform.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">By the end of the Fall 2000, the first J-Orchestra 
      prototype was built.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">During 2001, Austin Chau,
      Kane See, Dean Mao, and Hailemelekot Seifu
 have experimented with building early prototypes
      of various parts of J-Orchestra and created many of its example
      applications.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;By the end of 2001, J-Orchestra had most of its backend
    functionality implemented. It ran as a command line utility using several
    Unix utilities such as awk and grep.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;In the Spring and Summer of 2002, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ipvs/vs/en/people/handtems/" target="_blank">Marcus
    Handte</a> wrote the J-Orchestra GUI and prototype profiler, and
    contributed to the code base. He also helped with designing the present
    architecture of the tool and improving the development process.</li>
  <li>In the beginning of 2003, J-Orchestra was successfully used to partition a
    third-party, binary-only commercial Java application. The application is the
    JBits FPGA simulator by <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/" target="_blank">Xilinx</a>.</li>
  <li>In June of 2003, following multiple requests from our colleagues, J-Orchestra was made publicly available.</li>
