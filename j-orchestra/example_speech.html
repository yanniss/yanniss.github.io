    <h1>Speech API Demo Example</h1>
        
    <p><b>Note</b>: It is highly recommended to have completed <a href="example_clock1.html">Tutorial
    Part I</a> before trying this example.
        
    <br><br>In this example, a Swing application showcases the Java Speech API
    and&nbsp;<br>
    works as follows: the user chooses predefined phrases from a dropdown&nbsp;<br>
    box and the speech synthesizer pronounces them. As a motivation for&nbsp;<br>
    partitioning, imagine a scenario when this application needs to be run<br>
    on a machine, e.g. a PDA, that either has no speakers (hardware resource)<br>
    or does not have the Speech API installed (software resource). The idea<br>
    is to partition the original application in a client-server mode so that the<br>
    graphical partition (i.e. the GUI) would run on a PDA and it will control<br>
    the speech partition which would run on a desktop machine. We choose<br>
    this example because it fits well into the realm of applications amenable<br>
    for automatic application partitioning. The locality patterns here are very<br>
    clear and defined by the specific hardware resources (graphical screen<br>
    and speech synthesizer) and their corresponding classes (Swing and Speech
    API).<br>
    <br>
    In-order to run this example, you have to download <a href="http://www.cloudgarden.com/JSAPI/dnld_options.html">Cloudgarden's
    Java Speech API.<br>
    </a>1) Once the Speech API package is successfully installed, download and
    unjar <a href="resources/Speech.jar">Speech.jar</a><br>
    that contains all the file of the example.<br>
    2) Load Speech.xml configuration and perform the distribution.<br>
    (See <a href="example_clock1.html">Tutorial I</a> for detailed
    instructions).</p>
        
    <p>Now you ready to run the partitioned version of the application:<br>
    3) Run the server at ./step4/desktop: <i>startServer.bat </i>or <i>startServer.sh</i><br>
    4) Run the client part at ./step4/pda: <i>java
    remotecapable.speech.SpeechWindow</i></p>
