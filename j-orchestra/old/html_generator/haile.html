<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I have just started researching on the methodolgy of
determining how many bytes are held by primitives and
objects when they are serialized (transmitted) to various
nodes.  Also,  I will be testing out the profiler to ensure
that it is serializing the right number of bytes for different
objects and primitives.</p>
