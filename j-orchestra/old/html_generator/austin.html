<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I have developed mostly bytecode engineering and rewriting tools with the BCEL library, for things like adding 
mutators/accessors for class on bytecode level, renaming field references, etc.  I also built another tool to generate a snapshot callgraph of
how classes communicate in an application statically from their bytecodes.  I am also in charged of the GUI frontend of j-Orchestra, except
the visual representation of callgraph which is done by Dean.  </p>
