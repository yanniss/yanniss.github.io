<h2>About the name of jOrchestra:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In one of the final scenes of "Amadeus", the ailed composer is dictating the 
orchestral score of his requiem to his assistant specifying precisely what notes each 
individual instrument of the orchestra plays. Perhaps the sheer genius of Mozart allowed 
him to compose in a form of a complete orchestral score. More likely it was the plot of 
creative fantasy of the movie's producer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Few orchestral pieces are ever composed as a complete orchestral score. Quite 
often an orchestral piece starts as a piano improvisation. Then a composer might start 
jotting down the main melody and perhaps some chords. Once the composer gets the 
melody and harmony right, they get recorded in a piano score. One could claim that 
producing this piano score is the most important part of composing music: after all, a 
pianist can perform the completed piano score in its own right. To be performed by an 
orchestra or a chamber group, the newly composed piece has to be orchestrated. 
The art of orchestration is different from composition. Composition is deciding 
what notes to use and how to make them sound right together. Orchestration is 
determining what instrument should play each of the notes of the completed piano score. 
Usually it is the composers themselves who orchestrate their own music. However, it is 
not always the case. It is totally possible to have one person compose a piano score and 
then have someone else orchestrate it.  In addition to that, there are many examples of 
orchestrating piano music that was never intended for orchestral performance by the 
composers who wrote it. A number of piano pieces have several brilliant but totally 
different orchestrations.</p>

        The J-Orchestra system does the same thing to centralized Java programs as 
orchestration to completed piano scores. We start from a completed, centralized Java 
program and then partition it into several distributed segments that communicate to each 
other through the RMI. Our orchestration process is semi-automatic. First we ask the user 
how many instruments (network nodes) we have. Each network node can have some 
unique capabilities very much like a musical instrument. That might be the reason why 
certain pieces of code must be placed on a particular node. After that, we use profiling, 
static analysis, and byte code engineering to produce the optimum partitioning 
(orchestration) of the original program. In order to coordinate the execution of the 
resulting distributed program, we have a run-time system. Its role is very similar to the 
one of the conductor.</p>
