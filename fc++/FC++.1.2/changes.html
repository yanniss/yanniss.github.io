<title>FC++ Changes since last version</title>
</head>

<body>

This document summarizes the changes since the previous release of the
FC++ library.

<h2>New additions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Automatic currying</b>.  Now (practically) all functoids are
curryable by default.  For example, 
<pre>
   minus(3,2);   // yields 1
   minus(3);     // yields a new function f, where f(x) = 3-x
   minus(3,_);   // same as above
   minus(_,2);   // yields a new function f, where f(x) = x-2
</pre>
This is accomplished by the <code>CurryableN</code> classes, which
serve as wrappers around normal functions.  The function
<code>makeCurryableN()</code> turns an uncurryable function into an
automatically curryable version.  See <a
href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/currying.html">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/currying.html</a>
for more info.</li>

<li><b>Namespaces</b>.  Now the library is in namespace
<code>fcpp</code>.  However, bugs in the g++2.95.2 compiler force us to keep
part of the library in the global namespace.  If you have a working
compiler, use the compiler option -DFCPP_USE_NAMESPACE to have the whole 
library be in the namespace.  There's a 
<pre>
   using namespace fcpp;
</pre> 
at the bottom of <code>prelude.h</code>, which dumps it all
into the global namespace anyway.  We've done that for backwards
compatibility (you can drop in the new library and your old code should
still work without changes), but feel free to remove it (we certainly
will, in a future revision).</li>

<li>There is now an implicit conversion from direct
functoids to indirect functoids (<code>FunN</code>s).  For example,
<pre>
   Fun1&lt;int,int,int&gt; f          = fcpp::plus;
   Fun1&lt;double,double,double&gt; g = fcpp::plus;
</pre>
both "do the right thing".</li>

<li>A number of "holes" in the library have been filled in; now
practically all of the general functions/classes (like
<code>ptr_to_fun()</code>, <code>monomorphizeN()</code>,
<code>CurryableN</code>, etc.) work for all sets of functions with 0-3
arguments.  (Previous versions of FC++ had spotty support.)</li>

<li>This file: we plan to keep track of changes between versions from
now on, and put the changes in the distribution.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>

<li>The <code>List</code> class has been completely re-implemented.
The old version had a number of problems (the major ones being that (1)
it was too eager (not lazy enough) in a number of cases, and (2) that
functions like <code>cons</code> had un-intuitive interfaces) that have
now been solved.  In our limited tests, the new <code>List</code> seems
to perform comparably with the old, but let us know if you notice a
speed difference.</li>

<li><code>List::WrappedType</code> has been renamed to 
<code>List::ElementType</code>.  The new name makes more sense,
especially in papers/tutorials.</li>

<li>Header dependencies have been minimized; the library should only
suck in the headers it needs now, which means faster compile-times.</li>

<li>A number of minor bugs have been fixed throughout the library.</li>

<li>The function <code>list_until</code> has been renamed
<code>listUntil</code> (consistent with
naming convention of other list functions).</li>

</ul>
