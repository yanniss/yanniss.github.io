<h1>FC++ compiler support</h1>

<p>
FC++ is written in Standard C++, and therefore should work with any
compliant C++ compiler.  Fully compliant C++ compilers are still pretty 
rare beasts, however.  As a result, we maintain this page, which
documents how the FC++ library works with different compilers.
</p>

<p>
If you have tried using FC++ with a compiler other than the ones listed
here, please <a href="mailto:lorgon@cc.gatech.edu">mail us</a> with
information about your experience (regardless of whether it was successful 
or not).
</p>

<p>
Note: all information in the table applies to the current release (v1.4)
of the FC++ library.  (You can see some old info 
<a href="compilers.1.3.html">here</a>.)

<td><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">g++2.95.2</a></td>
<td>It all works</td>
<td>There are a couple bugs in g++2.95.2 that we have work-arounds for.
First, bugs in the compiler prevent portions of FC++ from being put into
<code>namespace fcpp</code>.  As a result, those portions are just
dumped into the global namespace.  Second, g++ has a non-conforming
<code>&lt;iterator&gt;</code> library, which we correct for.  The
<code>config.h</code> file automatically detects this compiler version
and sets up the fixes, so FC++ works "out of the box" with this compiler
anyway.</td>

you can try out code.  Also, Comeau and Intel both share the same
compiler front-end.</td>
