<h1>FC++ lambda</h1>

New with v1.4 of the FC++ library is an experimental feature: lambda.  
To enable this feature, you need to use the compile-time option
<code>FCPP_ENABLE_LAMBDA</code>.  The motivation for lambda should be
obvious to any functional programmer.  Here are a few short examples
to introduce the syntax:

<pre>
   // a new functoid 'f' where f() = 3
   lambda()[ 3 ]     
   // a new functoid 'f' where f(x) = 3*x+1
   lambda(X)[ plus[multiplies[3,X],1] ]     
   // a new functoid 'f' where f(x) = x! (factorial x)
   lambda(X)[ l_if[equal[X,0],1,multiplies[X,SELF[minus[X,1]]]] ]
   // a new functoid 'f' where f(g,x) = g(x,x)
   lambda(G,X)[ G[X,X] ]     
</pre>

More generally, the approximate syntax for creating an FC++ lambda is

<pre>
   lambda( &lt;lambda_vars&gt; )[ &lt;lambda_expr&gt; ]
where
   lambda_var is an instance of fcpp_lambda::LambdaVar (see below)
and
   lambda_expr is one of
      normal FC++ value
      &lt;lambda_var&gt;
      &lt;lambda_expr&gt;[ &lt;lambda_exprs&gt; ]
      l_if[ &lt;lambda_expr&gt;, &lt;lambda_expr&gt;, &lt;lambda_expr&gt; ] 
      // the last one is "lambda if": l_if[ expr, true_result, false_result ]
</pre>

The result is a new functoid with the desired behavior.

<h2>Important Details and Limitations</h2>

<p>
Every attempt at creating a true lambda within standard C++ is doomed to 
failure--the language simply doesn't have the tools to add such an
extension.  Nevertheless, a number of libraries (like the Boost Lambda
Library) "approximate" lambda in one way or another, and FC++ has
finally joined their ranks.  We have taken a unique approach to lambda
which we think fits well with the rest of FC++.  But it is
important for users to understand the limitations of our lambda, as well
as a few important details about how it works.  The goal of this section
is to emphasize the weaknesses of lambda--not to turn you off to the
feature, but to warn you so you will not fall into any of its pitfalls.
</p>

<p>
First off, notice that we use square brackets (rather than parentheses)
as the 'function call operator' within our lambda expressions.  Indeed,
we have essentially designed a tiny "functional application language"
for <code>lambda_expr</code>s which only comprises values,
applications, and <code>l_if</code>s.  The goal was a language which
appears <i>familiar</i> enough to be obvious to code with, but also
<i>different</i> enough from normal C++ code that users will be unlikely
to accidentally mix the two up.  The key danger is that, unlike a true 
lambda in a true functional programming language, our lambda cannot
"delay evaluation" of whatever is inside it.  The
facade of lambda cannot prevent the C++ compiler from doing its normal
job evaluating expressions.  If you say something like
<pre>
   lambda()[ f(++i) ]       // don't do this!
</pre>
you will <i>not</i> get a new zero-argument functoid that, when called,
will increment <code>i</code> and call <code>f</code>.  Rather, C++
will increment <code>i</code> and call <code>f</code> (possibly with
effects) <i>right now</i>; the result of the entire expression will be
a functoid which takes no arguments and returns a <i>constant</i>
(whatever value <code>f</code> returned).  The moral is to stay away
from C++ expressions inside a lambda; probably the only characters that
should appear inside a lambda are identifier characters, square
brackets, and commas.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to the next important detail.  We've obviously
overloaded the <code>operator[]</code> of functoids and
<code>LambdaVar</code>s to work some lambda-magic.  But as C++
programmers may know, <code>operator[]</code> must take exactly one
argument.  Then how is it that examples like
<pre>
   lambda(X)[ plus[multiplies[3,X],1] ]     
</pre>
work, where the <code>operator[]</code> of <code>plus</code> and
<code>multiplies</code> appear to be taking two arguments?  We have
cheated by overloading <code>operator,</code>--yes, the comma operator.
For the most part this works just fine and gives the illusion that you
can put multiple arguments in square brackets.  But the illusion fails
in two cases.  First, you would probably expect that
<pre>
   lambda(F,X)[ F[2,3,X] ](foo,4)
</pre>
would end up calling
<pre>
   foo(2,3,4)
</pre>
but you'd be wrong.  The comma operator cannot be overloaded for
builtin types, and as a result, the subexpression "<code>2,3</code>"
inside the "call" to <code>F</code> evaluates to just <code>3</code>
(discarding the value <code>2</code>), and so, in fact,
<pre>
   foo(3,4)
</pre>
is the result.  Yuck.  Fortunately, compilers are likely to tell you
when you make such an error: for example, g++ is kind enough to say
something like
<pre>
   lam.cc: In function `int main()':
   lam.cc:25: warning: left-hand operand of comma expression has no effect
</pre>
when commas are accidentally abused.  Second, the natural syntax for
calling a zero-argument functoid inside a lambda cannot be used:
<pre>
   lambda(F,G)[ F[ G[] ] ]      // illegal
</pre>
as "<code>G[]</code>" simply does not parse in C++.  As a result, we've
introduced our own syntax kludge to call a functoid with no arguments:
<pre>
   lambda(F,G)[ F[ G[_*_] ] ]   // ok; h(f,g) = f(g())
   // "_*_" means no arguments
</pre>
Ugly.  If you have an idea for something else to represent the "nothing"
argument (which still looks abnormal enough that it won't be confused
with a real argument), please let us know. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, you are probably wondering about those lambda variables like
<code>F</code> and <code>X</code>.  They are just instances of
<code>LambdaVar&lt;i&gt;</code>, defined as
<pre>
   LambdaVar<0> SELF;
   LambdaVar<1> F;
   LambdaVar<2> G;
   LambdaVar<3> H;
   LambdaVar<4> X;
   LambdaVar<5> Y;
   LambdaVar<6> Z;
</pre>
Each one has a unique type.  You can define your own if you want to
choose your own names:
<pre>
   LambdaVar<101> FOO;
   ... lambda(FOO)[ plus[3,FOO] ] ...
</pre>
but be sure to use unique integers as the argument to
<code>LambdaVar</code>.  FC++'s lambda ignores everything but the type
of <code>LambdaVar</code>s, so if two different lambda variables have 
the same type, unexpected things may happen.
</p>

<h2>What it's good for</h2>

<p>
Ok, enough bad-mouthing.  Lambda is useful, provided you avoid its
traps.  In some cases, you can live without lambda rather easily; for
example, a number of examples from the top of this page
<pre>
   lambda()[ 3 ]     
   lambda(X)[ plus[multiplies[3,X],1] ]     
</pre>
can be concocted rather easily in FC++ without lambda:
<pre>
   const_(3)
   compose( plus(1), multiplies(3) )
</pre>
However some functions are not so easy to compose on-the-fly.  Suppose
you want want this function:
<pre>
   lambda(X,Y)[ f[g[X],h[Y]] ]
</pre>
The library functoid <code>compose2</code> almost does the job, but not
quite.  Without lambda, you'd be forced to either 
<ul>
<li>write a dozen lines of code to define your own
special-purpose functoid called <code>f_gx_hy</code> or something, or</li>
<li>be clever enough to to discover that
<pre>
   uncurry(compose(compose(_,h),compose(f,g)))
</pre>
does the job.  Not so obvious what <i>that</i> code is doing, is it?  
The corresponding lambda is much easier to read. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, that's exactly what lambda is good for.  When you need a
one-time, special purpose function, and you can't easily compose it out
of existing functoids and combinators, use lambda.  That's what it's
there for. 
</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

Lambda is an "experimental feature", and we welcome feedback about it.
In the future, we plan to publish a document explaining our design
ratonale for the feature as it stands, but in the meantime, we are open
to comments on how it might be improved.
