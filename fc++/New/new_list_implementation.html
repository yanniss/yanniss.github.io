<h1>FC++ lazy list implementation</h1>

<p>
As of v1.3, lists have been completely reimplemented in a way that is
far more efficient than the previous implementation.  This document
describes the new list implementation structure, and how you can write
functoids to take advantage of the new structure to be more efficient.
</p>

<p>
If, instead, you don't actually care about the new list structure, but
you just want your now-broken code to compile again, jump down to

<h3>Lists, Caches, and OddLists</h3>

There are three main structures in the new implementation: Lists,
Caches, and OddLists.  They are characterized by these equations:
<pre>
   List&lt;T&gt;      = pointer to a Cache&lt;T&gt;
   OddList&lt;T&gt;   = pair&lt; T, List&lt;T&gt; &gt;
   Cache&lt;T&gt;     = variant{ Fun0&lt; OddList&lt;T&gt; &gt;
                       or  OddList&lt;T&gt;         }
</pre>
Pictorially, 
<table border><tr><td>
<img src="list_structures.gif">
</td></tr></table>
In pseudo-C++
<pre>
   template &lt;class T&gt; class List {
      IRef&lt; Cache&lt;T&gt; &gt; rep;
   };
   template &lt;class T&gt; class OddList {
      T first;
      List&lt;T&gt; second;
   };
   template &lt;class T&gt; class Cache {
      enum { UNCACHED, CACHED } state;
      Fun0&lt; OddList&lt;T&gt; &gt; fxn;   // valid in the "uncached" state
      OddList&lt;T&gt; value;         // valid in the "cached" state
   };
</pre>

<h3>The significance of Caches</h3>

Caches enable laziness in a way that is efficient.  Caches can either be
in an "uncached" state, where the function is the valid member of the
variant, or in a "cached" state, where the value is valid.  Consider the code
<pre>
   List&lt;int&gt; l = enumFrom(1);
   cout << head(l) << endl;
</pre>
After executing that, here is a picture of memory, where the variable
<code>l</code> is represented by the little box at the left:
<table border><tr><td>
<img src="enumFrom1.1.gif">
</td></tr></table>
Suppose now we say
<pre>
   cout << head(tail(l)) << endl;
</pre>
Here is what happens:
<ol>
<li>We try to evaluate <code>tail(l)</code>.  Since <code>l</code>'s
<code>Cache</code> is in the "cached" state, we simply return the next
node of the list (<code>l.rep-&gt;value.second</code>).</li> <li>We
call <code>head()</code> on that result.  Since this is an "uncached"
<code>Cache</code>, we must execute the function to get the value, and
then return it (<code>value=fxn(); state=CACHED; return
value;</code>)</li>
<li>The result is printed.</li>
</ol>
As a result, things now look like this:
<table border><tr><td>
<img src="enumFrom1.2.gif">
</td></tr></table>

<h3>The significance of OddLists</h3>

<p>
OddLists are used for efficiency.  Consider
<pre>
   List&lt;T&gt; l = something();
   head(l);
</pre>
In order to evaluate <code>head(l)</code> (or <code>tail(l)</code> or
<code>null(l)</code>) we must see if the <code>Cache</code> is in the
"cached" state, and if not, call the <code>fxn</code> to produce the
<code>value</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now consider
<pre>
   head( cons(1,NIL) );
</pre>
If <code>cons()</code> were to return a <code>List</code>, then
<code>head()</code> would be forced to check to see if the
<code>Cache</code> were in the "cached" state before producing a value,
since that's how we just saw taking the head of a <code>List</code>
works.  However clearly that is unnecessary in this instance;
<code>cons()</code> always produces a "cached" value, as C++ is a
strict (non-lazy) language, and by passing parameters to
<code>cons()</code>, we have already evaluated the "value" of the list
node being produced.  As a result, rather than have <code>cons()</code>
return a <code>List</code>, it returns an <code>OddList</code>.
<code>OddList</code>s have exactly the same interface as lists, but
they are more efficient (at the opportunity cost of always having their
first element be non-lazy).
</p>

<h3>How to write functoids to take advantage of these structures</h3>

<p>
These structures matter most when writing recursive list functoids.
Consider, for example, <code>Map</code> written in the old style (where
everything is a <code>List</code>):
<pre>
struct Map {
   template &lt;class F, class L&gt;
   struct Sig : public FunType&lt;F,L,
      List&lt;typename F::template Sig&lt;typename L::ElementType&gt;::ResultType&gt; &gt; {};

   template &lt;class F, class T&gt;
   List&lt;typename F::template Sig&lt;T&gt;::ResultType&gt;
   operator()( const F& f, const List&lt;T&gt;& l ) const {
      if( null(l) )
         return NIL;
      else
         return cons( f(head(l)), curry2( Map(), f, tail(l) ) );
   }
};
</pre>
Note that the call to <code>cons()</code> takes two parameters, of these
types
<pre>
typename F::template Sig&lt;T&gt;::ResultType 
   (the list element type, let's call it "E" for short)
binder1and2of2&lt;Map,F,List&lt;T&gt; &gt;   // what curry2() returns
   (a zero-argument functoid that returns a List&lt;E&gt;)
</pre>
The second argument type is non-ideal.  <code>cons()</code> will return
an <code>OddList</code> which contains an <code>E</code> and a pointer
to a <code>Cache</code>, but that <code>Cache</code>'s thunk will be
ugly.  Recall that <code>Cache</code> thunks are functions that return
<code>OddList</code>s, but we have passed a function that returns a
<code>List</code> to <code>cons()</code>.  As a result, we have to
create a new thunk, which stores a reference to the one passed (call it
"f"), whose body is
<pre>
   return f().force();
</pre>
This makes the types work out, by transforming a function-that-returns-a-List
into a function-that-returns-an-OddList, but it has to use extra space and
time to do it.
</p>

<p>
Now consider <code>Map</code> written to return an <code>OddList</code>:
<pre>
struct Map {
   template &lt;class F, class L&gt;
   struct Sig : public FunType&lt;F,L,
      OddList&lt;typename RT&lt;F,typename L::ElementType&gt;::ResultType&gt; &gt; {};

   template &lt;class F, class L&gt;
   OddList&lt;typename RT&lt;F,typename L::ElementType&gt;::ResultType&gt;
   operator()( const F& f, const L& l ) const {
      if( null(l) )
         return NIL;
      else
         return cons( f(head(l)), curry2( Map(), f, tail(l) ) );
   }
};
</pre>
Now everything works nicely on the <code>cons()</code> end of things;
<code>curry2()</code> creates the right type of functoid to pass to
<code>cons()</code>, since <code>Map</code> has the "right" return
type.  There is no more "impedence mismatch" at the recursive call.
</p>

<p>
Note also that we've changed the type of <code>Map</code>'s second
parameter; rather than take only <code>List</code>s, we take
<code>L</code>, which could match an <code>OddList</code> or a
<code>List</code>.  This way, calls to
<pre>
   map( f, cons(1,NIL) );
</pre>
work, and we do not "waste" the known "cachedness" of the first element
of this list.  Transforming functions that take <code>List</code>s into
functions that take <code>L</code>s (where <code>L</code> is a template
parameter) is nearly the same as writing two overloaded versions of the
function--one that works on <code>OddList</code>s, and one that works
on <code>List</code>s.
</p>

<h3>Implications for laziness</h3>

<p>
There's a great paper about adding laziness to strict languages, 
<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/wadler/topics/language-design.html">
"How to add laziness to a strict language, without even being odd"</a>,
which explains where we got the name OddList from.  However, the "odd"
lists described in that paper always evaluate "one too far ahead" in a list,
whereas FC++'s OddLists effectively have "even" tails, which means only
the original call is too eager; the recursive calls are fine.  Thus,
the example from that paper:
<pre>
   cutoff( 5, map( sqrt, countdown(4) ) );
</pre>
returns the right answer in FC++.  The only time FC++ is too eager is in
the edge case; this code
<pre>
   cutoff( 0, map( sqrt, countdown(-1) ) );
</pre>
throws an exception.  We believe that this is "how it should be".  C++
is strict, and therefore a call to map should "do work".  If you wanted
to original call to map to be lazy, you would have written
<pre>
   List<float> l = curry2( map, sqrt, countdown(-1) );
   cutoff( 0, l );
</pre>
that is, you would have curried the first call to make it lazy.  Indeed,
the code above works fine in FC++, returning the empty list.
</p>
   
<h3>Interface comparison with previous List implementation</h3>

<p>
Let's move on to more pragmatic issues.  Lists and OddLists both support
the same external interface; here are things you can do with an
<code>L</code>:
<pre>
   L l;     // L may be List or OddList
   head(l);
   null(l);
   tail(l);        // always returns List
   cons(3,l);      // always returns OddList
   l.head();
   l.tail();
   l.operator bool();   // !null(l)

   // The new stuff
   l.force();      // return an OddList of me
   l.delay();      // return a List of me
   // There are also implicit conversions between OddList and List
</pre>
<code>List</code> actually supports a little more functionality than
<code>OddList</code> does (it contains the iterator interface, both to make
a list from a pair of iterators, and to use the <code>begin()</code> and
<code>end()</code> member functions), but for the vast majority of
tasks, the two are completely interchangeable.

<h3>How to get away with being ignorant of the new List structure</h3>
</a>

<p>
If all you care about is making broken code compile; here's the
quickie guide to how to fix broken code.  Say you'd written this, which
works with pre-v1.3 FC++:
<pre>
   struct SomeFunc {
      template &lt;class L&gt;
      struct Sig : public FunType&lt;L,L&gt; {}; 

      template &lt;class T&gt;
      List&lt;T&gt; operator()( const List&lt;T&gt;& l ) const {
         // probably a more interesting body
         return l;
      }
   } some_func;

   int main() {
      some_func( cons(1,NIL) );   // compiler error
   }
</pre>
and have been annoyed to discover that it gives a compiler error with
the new version of the library:
<pre>
   tmp2.cc: In function `int main()':
   tmp2.cc:20: no match for call to `(SomeFunc) (fcpp::OddList<int>)'
</pre>
The solution is simple; the call should be
<pre>
      some_func( cons(1,NIL).delay() );
</pre>
More generally, when the compiler tells you that you have an
<code>OddList</code>, and you just want a <code>List</code>, call
<code>delay()</code> on it and all will be well.
