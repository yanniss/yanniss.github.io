<h1>FC++ Logos</h1>

<p>
When we're not writing code for the library, sometimes we enjoy trying
to come up with a better FC++ logo.  Here are the logos we have made;
most of them use a greek lambda, a symbol which often stands for
functional programming.  If you have some artistic talent (almost
certainly it will be more than we have!), feel free to 
<a href="mailto:lorgon@cc.gatech.edu">mail us</a> your own creations;
with your permission, we may add your artwork to this page (or maybe
even use it on the front page as our new logo).
