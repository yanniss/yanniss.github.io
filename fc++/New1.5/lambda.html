<h1>FC++ Lambda</h1>

<p>
The main new feature in v1.5 of the FC++ library is "lambda".
Like some other C++ template libraries, we use expression templates to
mimic "lambda" functionality (the ability to create new anonymous
functions on the fly) found in many functional languages.  Our approach
is a little different from other C++ lambda libraries.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Note:</b> To enable the lambda portion of the library, you must say
<pre>
#define FCPP_ENABLE_LAMBDA
</pre>
to get the lambda portions of the library included.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Here is a short example to introduce lambda:
<pre>
   LambdaVar&lt;1&gt; X;
   LambdaVar&lt;2&gt; Y;
   // The next line prints 10:
   cout << lambda(X,Y)[ plus[ multiplies[3,X], Y ] ] (3,1) << endl;
   // or  "lambda(X,Y)[ (3 %multiplies% X) %plus% Y ]"  using <a href="infix.html">infix syntax</a>
</pre>
There are three main components to the example:
<ul>

<li>the use of <code>LambdaVar</code> to declare variables to be used in
lambda expressions</li>

<li><code>lambda(</code><i>lambdaVars</i><code>)[</code><i>lambdaExp</i><code>]</code>,
which creates a lambda (anonymous function) on-the-fly</li>

<li>lambda expressions, which have functoids use <code>operator[]</code>
rather than <code>operator()</code> (and <code>%</code> instead of
<code>^</code>) for function calls</li>

</ul>
Those are the basics.  You can declare as many <code>LambdaVar</code>s
as you like, but make sure that each one uses a distinct integer
template argument.
</p>

<p>
Unlike some other C++ lambda libraries, which try to integrate lambda
into C++ in a way that makes "lambda code" look almost like normal C++
code, we choose to try to distinguish lambda code from normal C++ code 
in a number of ways.  By convention, we name lambda variables with
capital letters to make them stand out.  We use square brackets instead
of parentheses for function calls.  And we use the percent sign instead
of the carat for our "infix" syntax.  We think all of these syntax
choices and conventions make "lambda code" stand out from normal C++
code, so that it's easy to tell the difference between what's lambda
code and what's normal C++ code.  We think this is a good thing, due to
the caveats that come with trying to mimic lambda in C++, which we
explain next.
</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>
Every C++ lambda library carries with it two worrisome
issues.  First, C++ will always try to eagerly evaluate expressions when
it knows how, so unless an expression involves some of our "special
lambda syntax" (a <code>LambdaVar</code>, <code>[]</code>, or
<code>%</code>), it will be evaluated immediately by C++ rather than
"delayed" as intended by the FC++ lambda library.  Here are some
examples:
<pre>
   lambda()[ doSomething(3) ]  // oops, used () instead of []
   // If doSomething has a side-effect, that effect will happen once,
   // right now, rather than being delayed
    
   lambda()[ doSomething[3] ]  // Ok, calls doSomething when lambda invoked
   
   
   lambda(X)[ foldl[ plus, 0, X ] ]  // oops, "plus, 0" is a comma-expression
   // The above does not create a function to sum the integers in a list
   
   lambda(X)[ foldl[plus][0][X] ]    // Ok, use currying to avoid commas
   
   lambda(X)[ foldl[ plus, X, someList ] ]  // Ok, comma-exp involves X
</pre>
Note that calls like <code>f[x,y,z]</code> use <code>operator,</code>
(comma operator) because the C++ <code>operator[]</code> must take
exactly one argument.  This begs the question of how to create a lambda
expression representing a no-argument call.  We have invented the
following (admittedly ugly) syntax:
<pre>
   lambda()[ someZeroArgumentFunctoid[_*_] ]  
</pre>
where <code>_*_</code> represents the absence of an argument.  The
example above is rather trivial and pointless, but using zero-argument
functions in a lambda can be useful in cases like
<pre>
   lambda(X)[ X %plus% getCurrentTime[_*_] ]
</pre>
which results in a new function which takes a number (representing a
time offset) and returns the current time plus the offset.
</p>

<p>
The second big issue common to C++ lambda libraries is that compiler
error messages tend to be especially verbose when you do something wrong
(owing to the use of expression templates to create the "delayed
evaluation" effect).  The library tries to inject useful identifiers
which explain the error for certain common types of errors, but making
sense of verbose C++ compiler diagnostics typically takes a little
practice.  The <code>main()</code> function in the <code>lam2.cc</code> 
client file contains a number of examples of erroneous uses of lambda;
you might want to have a look and see what kinds of errors your compiler
generates on these examples to get accustomed to the types of diagnostics 
you may encounter when debugging your own lambda code.
</p>

<h3>Advanced features</h3>

<p>
The examples above have shown basic use of
lambda.  Now we show some of the more advanced features of lambda and
introduce the syntax of our inner "lambda language".
</p>

<p>
Lambdas exhibit variable <b>capture</b>.  That is, you can say
<pre>
   lambda(Y)[ lambda(X)[ (3 %multiplies% X) %plus% Y ] ]
</pre>
and the result is a one-argument function which takes a number, and
returns a new one-argument function which multiplies its argument by 3
and then adds the original number.  Note that the variable
<code>Y</code> is "captured" by the inner lambda.
</p>

<p>
Lambdas have an <b>if-then-else expression</b> construct:
<pre>
   if0[ boolLambdaExp, trueLambdaExp, falseLambdaExp ]
   if1[ boolLambdaExp, trueLambdaExp, falseLambdaExp ]
   if2[ boolLambdaExp, trueLambdaExp, falseLambdaExp ]
</pre>
There are three versions of "if" which differ in the way they infer the
result type of the entire lambda expression.  <code>if0</code> ensures
that both the "true" and "false" branches have the same type.
<code>if1</code> uses just the "true" branch to infer the result type of
the whole expression; conversely <code>if2</code> uses the "false"
branch.  The utility of these will become more apparent when we
introduce <code>letrec</code> below.
</p>

<p>
Like many functional languages, we have a way to <b>bind variables</b> to
values:
<pre>
   let[ X == someLambdaExp,
        Y == someOtherLambdaExpWhichMayInvolveX ]
   .in[ someLambdaExpInvolvingXandY ]
</pre>
We also have <b>letrec</b>, to do concurrent assignments, which
are especially useful for recursive functions like
<pre>
   lambda(X)[ 
      letrec[ F == lambda(Y)[ if1[ Y %equals% 0, 
                                   1, 
                                   Y %multiplies% F[Y %minus% 1] ] ] ]
      .in[ F[X] ] ]
</pre>
which defines the factorial function on-the-fly.  <code>letrec</code> is
needed because the definition of <code>F</code> refers to
<code>F</code> itself.  Here we use <code>if1</code> to tell FC++ to
determine the result type of the whole "if" expression based on the type
of the "true" branch (the <code>int</code> <code>1</code>).  We do this
because FC++ isn't smart enough to figure out the type of the "false"
branch (because of the recursive call).

<h3>Monads</h3>
</a>

<p>
Lambda makes it practical to define monads in FC++.  This portion of
this document assumes the reader has some familiarity with monads in
Haskell.  (To learn more about monads, check out
the links at 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/bookshelf/">The Haskell Bookshelf</a>
under the heading "Using Monads".)
</p>

<p>
The <code>monad.h</code> FC++ header file defines monads for FC++.  We
create the monad functoids: <code>unit</code>, <code>bind</code>,
<code>bind_</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>join</code>, and we
define lambda-syntax for do-notation and comprehensions.  FC++ defines
the following monads: <code>ListM</code>, <code>MaybeM</code>,
<code>IdentityM</code>, <code>StateM</code>, and <code>ByNeedM</code>.  
(Note that
<code>List</code> is the name of a datatype whereas <code>ListM</code>
is the name (tag) for the list monad.  See the end of
<code>monad.h</code> to see what corresponds to "instance declarations"
in Haskell.)  Instances of monads can be "inferrable" when the types
are explicit (rather than just type synonyms or aliases);
<code>List</code>, <code>Maybe</code>, and <code>ByNeed</code> 
are inferrable monads.
(Non-inferrable monads require that the monad be passed explicitly as a
template parameter to some constructs; the examples below will clarify
this.)  Monads may also have a <code>zero</code>; again
<code>List</code> and <code>Maybe</code> are examples.  </p>

<p>
Here are a list of the monad functoids defines by FC++.  The ones whose
names end in <code>M</code> require that the C++ tag for the monad be
passed explicitly as a parameter.
<pre>
   bind bind_ unitM bindM bindM_ zeroM mapM joinM
</pre>
Here is the syntax for "do" and "comprehensions":
<pre>
   doM[ <i>thing</i>, <i>thing</i>, ..., <i>thing</i> ]
      where <i>thing</i> is one of these
       - a lambda expression (bind_)
       - a "gets" expression of the form "LV <= lambdaExp" (bind)
      the final <code>thing</code> is typically a call to unitM
      Note: doM can only be used with inferrable monads.

   compM&lt;<i>someMonad</i>&gt;()[ <i>lambdaExp</i> | <i>stuff</i>, <i>stuff</i>, ..., <i>stuff</i> ]
   	where <i>stuff</i> is one of these
       - a lambda expression (bind_)
       - a "gets" expression of the form "LV <= lambdaExp" (bind)
       - a "guard" expression of the form "guard[boolLambdaExp]"
      Note: guards can only be used in monads with a zero.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now some examples.  Here's a <code>lambdaExp</code> to describe all
pair of integers where the first integer is selected from the list
[1,2] and the second from the list [3,4] using "do" notation:
<pre>
   doM[ X &lt;= list_with(1,2), Y &lt;= list_with(3,4), 
           unitM&lt;ListM&gt;()[ makePair[X,Y] ] ]
</pre>
and here's the same thing using a comprehension in the list monad:
<pre>
   compM&lt;ListM&gt;()[ makePair[X,Y] | X&lt;=list_with(1,2), Y&lt;=list_with(3,4) ]
</pre>
Here's an example where the comprehension has guards:
<pre>
   compM&lt;ListM&gt;()[ makePair[X,Y] | X&lt;=list_with(1,2), guard[true], 
          Y&lt;=list_with(3,4), guard[ (Y %divides% X) %equal% 3 ] ] ]
</pre>
Unlike Haskell, in FC++, we can do comprehensions in any monad (not
just lists).  Here's an example with some surrounding C++ code:
<pre>
   Maybe&lt;int&gt; mx = just(2);
   Maybe&lt;int&gt; my = just(3);
   mx = lambda()[ compM&lt;MaybeM&gt;()[ plus[X,Y] | X&lt;=mx, Y&lt;=my, guard[false] ] ]();
   cout &lt;&lt; mx &lt;&lt; endl;   // Nothing
</pre>
Hopefully these examples give an idea of what it's like to program with
monads in FC++.
</p>


<h3>C++ types for lambdas (the "LEType" type computer)</h3>

<p>
As with practically every C++ expression-template library, the C++ types
of the resulting values tend to have hideously long names.  Trying to
spell out by hand the type name of even a simple lambda expression 
is practically impossible.  But if we want to write a tiny
(contrived) function which returns a lambda, like
<pre>
/* ??? */ foo() {
   LambdaVar&lt;1&gt; X;
   LambdaVar&lt;2&gt; Y;
   return lambda()[ let[ X == 4, Y == 1 ].in[ minus[X,Y] ] ];
}
</pre>
then we need a way to name the result type.  Thus we supply a type
computer called <code>LEType</code>.  It uses a special sub-language
which mimics our lambda language to compute the types of lambda
expressions.  Thus we can name the type of the lambda expression above
with
<pre>
LEType&lt;LAM&lt;LET&lt;BIND&lt;1,int&gt;,BIND&lt;2,int&gt;,
               CALL&lt;Minus,LV&lt;1&gt;,LV&lt;2&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;::Type
</pre>
This is still rather long and ugly, but at least it makes the task
feasible.
</p>

<p>
There are <code>LEType</code> names for each piece of lambda syntax;
here is the entire list:
<pre>
   CALL      [] (function call)
   LV        LambdaVar
   IF0       if0[]
   IF1       if1[]
   IF2       if2[]
   LAM       lambda()[]
   BIND      LambdaVar == value
   LET       let[].in[]
   LETREC    letrec[].in[]
   DOM       doM[]
   GETS      LambdaVar &lt;= value
   GUARD     guard[]
   COMP      compM&lt;monad&gt;[]
</pre>
You can look at the examples in some of the client files to see more
details about using <code>LEType</code>; the discussion here is
sufficient to describe the basics.  Fortunately, it is typically only
necessary to name the C++ type of a lambda expression when you need to
return a lambda expression from a function.
</p>

<h3>Further examples and information</h3>

<p>
The FC++ client files <code>lam2.cc</code>, <code>monad.cc</code>,
<code>parser.cc</code>, <code>by_need_monad.cc</code>, 
and <code>rep_min.cc</code> use the lambda
portion of the library in some examples.
