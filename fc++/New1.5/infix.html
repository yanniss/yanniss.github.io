<h1>New infix syntax</h1>

<p>
FC++ v1.5 offers a new infix syntax that can be used with <a
href="full.html">full functoids</a>.  The syntax is inspired by the 
Haskell programming language.
</p>

<p>
Given a two-argument full functoid which can normally be called as
<pre>
   f(x,y)
</pre>
you can now (as of v1.5) call the functoid using infix syntax as
<pre>
   x ^f^ y
</pre>
We overload <code>operator^</code> for full functoids to make this work.
The goal is to write more readable code, as some named functions "read"
best infix (rather than prefix).  For example,
<pre>
   plus(2,3)
</pre>
is ok, but
<pre>
   2 ^plus^ 3
</pre>
reads more nicely.
</p>

<p>
(Note that this also works for 3-argument functoids using implicit
currying.  Here's an example using the 3-ary functoid <code>foldl</code>:
<pre>
   plus ^foldl^ 0
</pre>
means the same as
<pre>
   foldl( plus, 0 )
</pre>
which results in a function which sums the values in an integer list.)
</p>

<p>
For <a href="lambda.html">lambda expressions</a>, we overload
<code>operator%</code> so that instead of
<pre>
   f[X,Y]
</pre>
you can write
<pre>
   X %f% Y
</pre>
See the discussion about <a href="lambda.html">lambda</a> for more
details.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> note that infix functions adopt the precedence and
associativity of their C++ operators.  So unless you know C++ operator 
precedence and associativity rules very well, we recommend that you use
parentheses:
<pre>
   // desired: y+3*x   ( Note: equals  y+(3*x) )
   y ^plus^ (3 ^multiplies^ x)   // good
   // probably wrong:   y ^plus^ 3^multiplies^x
</pre>
</p>
