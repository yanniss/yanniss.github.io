Getting started with FC++</h1>
This page provides some informal documentation for FC++. The page is mostly
intended for readers familiar with C++, but not with functional programming.
The paper "<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/fc++.main.pdf">Functional
Programming in C++</a>" provides a more complete (albeit somewhat terse)
overview of FC++.

<h3>
<a NAME="Sec1"></a><font size=+1>Downloading and Compiling</font></h3>
Download the library from the FC++ download web page. The library contains
a set of header files that you need to "include" in your programs, in much
the same way as the Standard Template Library. If (as expected) you have
downloaded FC++ in a separate directory, make sure that this directory
is in your "include" path during compilation.
<p>For a quick example, download the example/test files from the FC++ web
page (the test files are separate from the main library). All these files
have been tested and compile/run with no problems using <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.2.html">g++.2.95.2</a>.
For instance, you can compile Y.cc using the command line:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; g++ -I[fc++ path] -o Y Y.cc</pre>
where "fc++ path" is the path where you have put the FC++ library files.
<b>The
FC++ example files are the best way to learn to use the library!</b> Additionally,
the prelude.h file of FC++ contains the implementation of many polymorphic
operators, which are excellent examples of FC++ usage patterns.

<h3>
<a NAME="Sec2"></a>Library layout</h3>
The distribution contains the following files:
<pre>curry.h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the bindMofN() functoids, the curryN() operators, and Const()
function.h&nbsp;&nbsp; The indirect functoid classes (FunN) and supporting implementation
list.h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The List class and its support functoids
operator.h&nbsp;&nbsp; Operators like Plus, many conversion functions, misc
prelude.h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functions found in the Haskell Standard Prelude
ref_count.h&nbsp; Reference-counting pointer class
signature.h&nbsp; Classes like FunType (used for nested typedefs)</pre>
The easiest way to start using FC++ in your programs is to include the
file "prelude.h". This will, in turn, include all the other files you may
need.

<h3>
<a NAME="Sec3"></a>What are "functoids"?</h3>
In standard C++, <i>function objects</i> are commonly used to pass functions
by value to higher-order algorithms. For example, if you have two equal-length
lists of integers (<tt>list&lt;int></tt>), and you want to add their respective
elements together, you might call the C++ Standard Library function
<tt>transform</tt>
with
<tt>plus&lt;int>()</tt>, as illustrated here:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; First list:&nbsp; (1, 2, 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -\
&nbsp;&nbsp; Second list: (2, 4, 6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> transform() ->&nbsp; Result list: (3, 6, 9)
&nbsp;&nbsp; Function:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plus&lt;int>()&nbsp;&nbsp; -/</pre>
(We shall ignore the details of how <code>transform()</code> is called, as it would only
serve as a needless digression into STL iterators.)
<p>The key idea in the example above is that <tt>plus&lt;int>()</tt> is
a function object, which can be passed as an argument to another function.
If we had instead wanted to multiply the respective values in the lists
in our previous example, we would have passed
<tt>multiplies&lt;int>()</tt>
(and gotten the list (2,8,18) back as a result). In the STL, <tt>plus</tt>
and
<tt>multiplies</tt> are examples of "Adaptable Binary Functions". These
are function objects which use nested typedefs to name the argument types
and result types of the functions. These typedefs enable many of the STL
algorithms to work.
<p>In FC++ we use the term "functoids" for function representations. Thus,
functoids are classes that are used to represent functions. There are two
different kinds of functoids in FC++: <i>direct functoids</i>, and <i>indirect
functoids</i>. Each kind of functoid is good for a different purpose. Direct
functoids are essential in FC++ programming and will be described here.
Indirect functoids will be described <a href="#full">later</a>.
<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="Sec3.1"></a>Monomorphic direct functoids</h3>
<i>Monomorphic direct functoids</i> in FC++ are very similar in functionality
to STL adaptable function objects. For example, we could define a function
object named "divisible" as
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Divisible : public CFunType&lt;int, int, bool> {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool operator()( int x, int y ) const { return x%y==0; }
&nbsp;&nbsp; } divisible;

&nbsp;&nbsp; divisible( 10, 5 )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // returns true
&nbsp;&nbsp; divisible( 10, 4 )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // returns false</pre>
Note the inheritance from&nbsp;<a NAME="CFunType"></a><tt>CFunType&lt;int,
int, bool></tt>. This is what makes <tt>Divisible</tt> a monomorphic direct
functoid. A monomorphic direct functoid expressing a k-argument function
should inherit from a class <tt>CFunType&lt;A1, A2, ..., Ak, R></tt>, where
A1, ..., Ak are the argument types for the function and R is its return
type. The inheritance is used to provide typedefs for the argument types
and result types (here the template arguments
<tt>&lt;int,int,bool></tt>
will get named something like Arg1Type, Arg2Type, and ResultType, respectively).
Of course, you could "manually" make your classes support the same conventions
as monomorphic direct functoids, instead of inheriting from a class like
<tt>CFunType&lt;...></tt>,
but this would be inconvenient.
<p>Note that the above definition differs from an STL-style function class
in that we inherit from
<tt>CFunType</tt> rather than from
<tt>binary_function</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Sec3.2"></a>Beyond monomorphic functoids: "Generic" function objects</h3>
Monomorphic direct functoids are the basis of all functoids in the FC++
library, but they have several limitiations (just like function objects
in STL). The most important limitation is that the <i>signatures</i> (argument
types and result types) of the objects named by <tt>plus&lt;int></tt>,
<tt>multiplies&lt;int></tt>,
and <tt>divisible</tt>, are all fixed. What if we want to create a truly
"generic" function object? For example, what if we want to pass "plus"
to an algorithm, but not specify the argument type--if the algorithm happens
to be applied to integers, we'll use integer-plus (addition), if the algorithm
is applied to strings, we'll use string-plus (concatenation), etc.--how
can we do that?
<p>We can easily make a generic function template in C++, like
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T>
&nbsp;&nbsp; T generic_plus( T x, T y ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return x+y;
&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
but template functions cannot be passed as arguments (we cannot pass the
value <tt>generic_plus</tt> to another function, because it is merely a
name, not a value). On the other hand, the standard C++ functor:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T>
&nbsp;&nbsp; struct plus : public binary_function&lt;T,T,T> {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T operator()(const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y) const { return x + y; }
&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>
is a class template that requires us to instantiate it with types in order
to use it; we cannot talk about just plain <tt>plus</tt>, we must talk
about <tt>plus&lt;int></tt> or
<tt>plus&lt;string></tt>. (Actually, so-called
"template-template parameters" do provide a way to decouple the name
<tt>plus</tt>
from its type parameter, but this idea does not generalize or scale to
provide a general solution framework.) So does this mean all is lost, and
that there's no way to talk about generic (polymorphic) function objects
in C++? No!<i> Polymorphic direct functoids</i> in FC++ provide the answer.
<h3>
<a NAME="Sec3.3"></a>Polymorphic direct functoids</h3>
Direct functoids can be used to describe polymorphic function objects.
The key is an idiom that wraps a function template inside a class, so that
we can create a concrete object that is still templatized when called as
a function. Here's the idea, applied to an addition function:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; struct AlmostPlus {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T operator()( const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y ) const {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return plus&lt;T>()( x, y );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp; } almost_plus;</pre>
We've named this "almost plus" because we're not quite done yet. But the
general idea is clear. Now we have created an object that can be passed
via parameter, and this object is a <i>polymorphic</i> function object
in that it can work on multiple types, thanks to the member function template.
We've jumped the first hurdle.
<p>Now the only problem is this: as we mentioned above, to enable many
higher-order functions, the function objects need to be "adaptable"--that
is they need nested typedefs to describe the signature of the function
(to name the argument types and result types). How can we do that for our
new function object? Using templates, of course!
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Plus {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>template &lt;class T, class U>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Sig : public FunType&lt;T,U,T> {};
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T operator()( const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y ) const {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return plus&lt;T>()( x, y );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp; } plus;</pre>
<a NAME="Sig"></a>Here <tt>Sig</tt> is a nested template struct, which
defines the needed typedefs. It inherits&nbsp;<a NAME="FunType"></a><tt>FunType</tt>,
which, in the case of two arguments, is (roughly) defined as
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class A1, class A2, class R><class A1, class A2, class R>
&nbsp;&nbsp; struct FunType {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef R ResultType;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef A1 Arg1Type;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef A2 Arg2Type;
&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>
Now our solution is complete. If an algorithm gets passed <tt>plus</tt>
as a parameter, and the algorithm intends to pass integer arguments to
it and wants to know what the result will be, the algorithm can refer to
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus::Sig&lt;int,int><int,int>::ResultType</pre>
<tt>Sig</tt> is effectively a "type computer". By using this idiom throughout
the library, higher-order polymorphic functions can deduce result types
of polymorphic function objects using the general form
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; FunctionObject::Sig&lt;ArgumentTypes><ArgumentTypes>::ResultType</pre>
We can now summarize all the requirements for direct functoids. To create
your own template functoids, you need to create a class with <i>both</i>
a template <tt>operator ()</tt> <i>and</i> a <tt>Sig</tt> member structure
template. The <tt>operator ()</tt> will allow your functoid to be polymorphic.
The <tt>Sig</tt> member should be a template over the argument types of
the function you want to express. That is, <tt>Sig</tt> can be used to
answer the question "what type will your function return if I pass it these
argument types?" For instance, for the two-argument function <tt>Plus</tt>,
<tt>Plus::Sig&lt;int,
int>::ResultType</tt> will be the type returned by
<tt>Plus</tt> for two
integer arguments. <tt>Sig</tt> members are essential in order for other
(pre-defined or user-defined) FC++ functoids to be able to interoperate
with your functoid. If the direct functoid is monomorphic, there is no
need to explicitly define a Sig structure--instead one can be inherited
from a <tt>CFunType</tt> class, as described <a href="#Sec3.1">earlier</a>.
<p>Polymorphic direct functoids can be converted into monomorphic ones
for a fixed type signature. This is done using the operators&nbsp;<a NAME="monomorphize"></a><tt>monomorphizeX</tt>
of FC++ (where X is the number of arguments that the functoid takes). For
instance, a monomorphic version of <tt>Plus</tt>, above, for integer arguments
can be obtained using the expression:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; monomorphize2&lt;int, int, int>(plus)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Example"></a>Example</h3>
A great example of a realistic direct functoid is the "map" functoid in
file <tt>prelude.h</tt>. "Map" is a function that takes another function,
<tt>f</tt>,
and a list, <tt>l</tt>, as parameters. It then applies <tt>f</tt> to each
subsequent element of <tt>l</tt> and returns a list of all the results.
Here's a quick example of a use of <code>map</code>:
<pre>
   List&lt;int&gt;  li = list_with(1,2,3);
   List&lt;bool&gt; lb = map( even, li );
   // now lb is the list (false,true,false)
</pre>
The FC++ implementation of <tt>map</tt> is shown below:
<pre>
  struct Map { 
    template &lt;class F, class L&gt; 
    struct Sig : public FunType&lt;F,L, 
      List&lt;typename F::template Sig&lt;typename L::ElementType&gt;::ResultType&gt; &gt; {}; 

    template &lt;class F, class T&gt; 
    typename Sig&lt;F, List&lt;T&gt; &gt;::ResultType 
    operator()( const F& f, const List&lt;T&gt;& l ) const { 
      if( null(l) ) 
        return NIL; 
      else 
        return cons( f(head(l)), curry2( Map(), f, tail(l) ) ); 
    } 
  }; 
</pre>
You can clearly see in the above code the two characteristic parts of
a direct functoid: the <tt>Sig</tt> member template class and the template
operator <tt>()</tt>.&nbsp; The code that implements the operator is very
simple, but the <tt>Sig</tt> structure is a little more interesting. It
is a template over two arguments, <tt>F</tt> and <tt>L</tt>, which correspond
to the type signatures of the function and list passed to map. Recall that
the <tt>Sig</tt> template is used to answer the question "what would <tt>map</tt>
return if it were passed arguments of types <tt>F</tt> and <tt>L</tt>?"
The answer in the above code is:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List&lt;typename F::template Sig&lt;typename
L::ElementType>::ResultType></tt>
<br>(Note the use of template <tt>FunType</tt> that conveys this information
but hides all the details of the implementation of <tt>Sig</tt>.)
<br>This means: "<tt>map</tt> returns a <tt>List</tt> of what <tt>F</tt>
would return if passed an element like the ones in list <tt>L</tt>". Here
is the explanation of the parts of this construct. The type of elements
in list <tt>L</tt> is <tt>L::ElementType</tt>. The return type of <tt>F</tt>
when passed an <tt>L::ElementType</tt> is <tt>F::template Sig&lt;typename
L::ElementType>::ResultType</tt>. The <tt>typename</tt> and <tt>template</tt>
keywords are needed to help the C++ compiler parse this expression.
<p>In reality, the signature of map could be somewhat simplified. Instead
of:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List&lt;typename F::template Sig&lt;typename
L::ElementType>::ResultType></tt>
<br>one could write:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List&lt;typename RT&lt;F, typename L::ElementType>::ResultType>
></tt>
<br><a NAME="RT"></a><tt>RT</tt> (stands for "Return Type") is just a template
that computes the return type of its first argument when it is called with
arguments of types equal to the other arguments of <tt>RT</tt>.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="predefined"></a>Predefined Functionality</h3>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="lazylists"></a>Lazy Lists</h3>
FC++ implements a lazy list data structure. Lazy data structures have their
data computed when needed, and not in advance. In essence, the data structure
holds both data and code that is used to produce more data. This code is
called transparently when the extra data are needed. For instance, one
can define an infinite list, and only the part that is actually needed
will ever be produced. The FC++ lazy lists are compatible with STL algorithms
(lazy list iterators support the protocol for STL input iterators) and
several conversions are supported between STL data structures and FC++
lazy lists.
<p>We saw an example of lazy list usage in the code for <tt>map</tt>, <a href="#Example">above</a>.
We reproduce some of this code here:
<pre>
    template &lt;class F, class T&gt;
    typename Sig&lt;F, List&lt;T&gt; &gt;::ResultType
    operator()( const F& f, const List&lt;T&gt;& l ) const {
      if( null(l) )
        return NIL;
      else
        return cons( f(head(l)), curry2( Map(), f, tail(l) ) );
    }
  };
</pre>
This code for map produces lazy lists. The lazy-list specific elements
in the code above are <tt>List</tt>, <tt>null</tt>, <tt>NIL</tt>, <tt>cons</tt>,
<tt>head</tt>,
and <tt>tail</tt>. <tt>List</tt> (note the capitalization) is the C++ type
for the lazy list and it is a template parameterized by the type of elements
stored in the list. <tt>null</tt> is a function testing whether the list
is empty. <tt>NIL</tt> is a constant representing an empty lazy list (of
any type of stored element!). <tt>cons</tt> is a function creating a new
lazy list node from the data the node will store and the code that produces
the rest of the lazy list. <tt>head</tt> returns the data stored in the
first node of a list. <tt>tail</tt> returns the list beyond the first node
of a given list. In the above code, <tt>map</tt> creates a new list (using
<tt>cons</tt>) that contains as its first node the data produced by function
<tt>f</tt> when applied to the first element of list<tt> l</tt> (that is,
<tt>f(head(l)</tt>). The rest of the result list is produced by applying
<tt>map</tt> again using function <tt>f</tt> and the rest of the input
list (that is, <tt>tail(l)</tt>).
<h3>
<a NAME="currying"></a>Currying (specialization)</h3>
Note how the <tt>curry2</tt> operator is used in the above code. <tt>curry2</tt>
takes a a 2-argument functoid as its first argument. It produces a specialized
functoid that binds the first arguments of <tt>curry2</tt>'s first argument
to the rest of the arguments of <tt>curry2</tt> (however many they are).
That is, <tt>curry2(Map(), f, tail(l))</tt> creates a new functoid that
does the same computation as <tt>map(f, tail(l))</tt>. The new functoid
takes no arguments (as we have fully specialized <tt>map</tt> by supplying
two arguments). <tt>curry2</tt> could have been called with 2 arguments,
e.g., <tt>map</tt> and a function, in which case it would only fix the
first argument of <tt>map</tt> and produce a 1-argument functoid that can
be applied to a list.
<p>In general, FC++ supplies&nbsp;<a NAME="curryN"></a><tt>curry<i>N</i></tt>
operators (<i><tt>N</tt></i> is an integer constant up to a predefined
maximum) that specialize the <i>first</i> arguments of an N-argument functoid.
Additionally, FC++ provides operators&nbsp;<a NAME="bindX"></a><tt>bind<i>X</i>and<i>Y</i>...of<i>N</i></tt>&nbsp;
that specialize (i.e., fix) the X-th, Y-th, etc. arguments of an N-argument
functoid. For instance,&nbsp; <tt>bind1and3of3(f, 2, 4)</tt> will fix the
first and third arguments of a 3-argument functoid <tt>f</tt> to 2 and
4, respectively.
<p>
Note: in the latest library revision (version 1.2), functoids are
curryable by default.  See the
<a href="./FC++.1.2/changes.html">new additions</a> to this version of
the library for more info.
<h3>
<a NAME="listfuns"></a>Other List Functions</h3>
There is a lot of functionality (i.e., algorithms) for lazy lists defined
by FC++. These functions are mostly re-implemented from functional language
libraries, especially the 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html">Haskell
Standard Prelude</a>. We will not exhaustively document these functions
here, but the FC++ examples are an excellent way to become familiar with
them. The most common such functions include <tt>map</tt>, <tt>foldl</tt>,
<tt>foldr</tt>,
<tt>scanl</tt>, <tt>scanr</tt>, <tt>iterate</tt>, <tt>drop</tt>,
<tt>cycle</tt>,
<tt>replicate</tt>, <tt>length</tt>, <tt>at</tt>, <tt>until</tt>,
<tt>filter</tt>,
<tt>concat</tt>, <tt>take</tt>, etc.
<h3>
<a NAME="compose"></a>Function Composition</h3>
A way to produce new functoids in FC++ is by composing existing functoids.
The functoid class that composes two existing functoids is <a NAME="Compose1"></a><tt>Compose1</tt>.
(An instance of it is defined and it is called <tt>compose</tt>.) For instance, the
expression:
<pre>
   compose(head, tail)
</pre>
creates a new functoid that implements the composition of <tt>head</tt>
and <tt>tail</tt>--i.e., an operation returning the second element of a
list. More importantly, that composition is polymorphic, exactly the same
way as <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> are polymorphic: it can be applied
to (homogeneous) lazy lists holding elements of any type.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="idioms"></a>Common FC++ Programming Idioms</h3>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="closures"></a>Closures</h3>
A common idiom in functional programming is encapsulating code together
with the data that it operates on. This is called "creating a closure".
Encapsulation is also the basis of object-oriented programming, so creating
closures in FC++ should seem quite intuitive if you are a C++ programmer.
To create a closure in FC++, one needs to create a functoid class (implementing
a function) and add data members to this class. The constructor for the
functoid class can then be used to initialize this data. Hence, an FC++
closure is just a functoid object (an instance of a functoid class) and
closing just means creating a functoid object.
<p>The FC++ implementation contains multiple examples of closure usage
(hint: look for classes named <tt>&lt;Something>Helper</tt> in the FC++
code). Consider the implementation of the <tt>curry2</tt> function (discussed
<a href="#currying">earlier</a>).
<tt>curry2</tt> called with 2 arguments returns a new functoid object,
that specializes <tt>curry2</tt>'s first argument by fixin <i>its</i> first
argument. That new functoid object is really a closure, as it needs to
hold the value for the specialized argument. The implementation is shown
below and the extra elements of a closure functoid (member variables, constructor)
can be seen clearly:
<p><tt>&nbsp;template &lt;class Binary, class Arg1></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;class binder1of2 {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Binary f;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arg1 x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;public:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binder1of2( const Binary&amp; a, const Arg1&amp;
b ) : f(a), x(b) {}</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Arg2></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Sig :</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public FunType&lt;Arg2,typename
Binary::Sig&lt;Arg1,Arg2>::ResultType> {};</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Arg2></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typename Binary::Sig&lt;Arg1,Arg2>::ResultType</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operator()( const Arg2&amp; y ) const {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return f(x,y);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;};</tt></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="full"></a>Indirect Functoids</h3>
A limitation of direct functoids (as well as STL function objects) is that
we cannot define run-time variables that range over different direct functoid
instances with the same type signature. For example, there is no way to
define a variable <tt>fun</tt> that can point to <i>any</i> functoid that
takes an integer value and returns another integer value. This observation
may at first seem wrong: After all, didn't we talk about STL functions
like <tt>transform</tt> that can take variable functoid arguments (e.g.,
either <tt>plus</tt> or <tt>multiplies</tt>)? Nevertheless, <tt>transform</tt>
does <i>not</i> actually limit its arguments to be functions from integers
to integers! Instead, it is a template function that is instantiated separately
for each function supplied to it as an argument (e.g., <tt>plus&lt;String></tt>
or <tt>multiplies&lt;float></tt>). This has two main disadvantages. First,
there are multiple instances of code created where a single instance would
suffice (all functions from integers to integers can be called using the
same calling code). Second, type errors are only discovered later during
the template instantiation (resulting in uninformative error messages)
or not at all (if the offending functionality is not actually exercised).
<p>Even more seriously, however, not being able to define variables over
direct functoids means that there is no way to store direct functoids in
dynamic data structures. For instance, one cannot create a (homogeneous)
list of direct functoids--that is a list whose every member is a potentially
different functoid (but they all have the same signature).
<p>Indirect functoids address the above problems. All indirect functoids
are subclasses of a class&nbsp;<a NAME="FunX"></a><tt>FunX</tt>, where
X is the number of arguments that the indirect functoid takes. Indirect
functoids are usually created from monomorphic direct functoids using the&nbsp;<a NAME="makeFunX"></a><tt>makeFunX</tt>
operators in FC++. (Indirect functoids can also be created explicitly by
subclassing the <tt>FunXImpl</tt> class, but this functionality will not
be covered here.) If "plus" and "multiplies" are monomorphic direct functoids
from integers to integers, a typical use of indirect functoids would be:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun2&lt;int, int, int> f = makeFun2(plus);
&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; f(3, 5) &lt;&lt; endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Prints 8
&nbsp;&nbsp; f = makeFun2(multiplies);
&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; f(3, 5) &lt;&lt; endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Prints 15</pre>
For polymorphic versions of "plus" and "multiplies", we would need to use
the operator <tt><a href="#monomorphize">monomorphize2</a></tt> first:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun2&lt;int, int, int> f = makeFun2(monomorphize2&lt;int,int,int>(plus));
&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; f(3, 5) &lt;&lt; endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Prints 8
&nbsp;&nbsp; f = makeFun2(monomorphize2&lt;int,int,int>(multiplies));
&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; f(3, 5) &lt;&lt; endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Prints 15</pre>
Note: with revision 1.2 of the library, it is unnecessary to use
<code>monomorphizeN</code> and <code>makeFunN</code> to convert a (possibly polymorphic) direct functoid
into an indirect one.  For example, with v1.2, you can just say
<pre>
   Fun2&lt;int,int,int&gt; f = fcpp::plus;
</pre>
and the conversions happen implicitly.
