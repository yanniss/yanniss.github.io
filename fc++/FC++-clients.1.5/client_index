This is an index of the example files.  There are now so many of them
that it helps to have an idea of what each one is about (especially
given the often-poor filenames).  Many of the examples don't do anything
too interesting/useful, in which case their description has been elided.

by_need_monad       Examples using ByNeed monad, which enables lazy
                       evaluation of arbitrary computations

callback2           | These programs show examples of using FC++ to
callback3           | create "callbacks", which are useful for event-
callback            | driven OO designs

compose2            Some currying tests

compose_ex          ...

conv_fun            Converts direct->indirect and shows subtype polymorphism

crry2               Currying examples (also Haskell-y hCurry/hUncurry)

cute_compose_syntax Example using "^of^" like Haskell's "." (compose)

example             Example using FC++ functoids with STL algorithms

foox                ...

fooy                ...

isort               ...

iter2               Converts STL container to FC++ List

iter                Uses STL algorithms on FC++ Lists

lam2                Main "lambda" test file

lazy_example        Example of lazy list (the final example really should 
                       use the ByNeed monad)

mem_fun             ...

monad0              | An early implementation of monads.
monad2              | These were done prior to "lambda"; now we have
monad3              | much better ways to do monads (below).

monad_0             | 
monad_2             | The newer implementation of the above.

operator            Examples of functoid versions of C++ operators

ord_test            Tests list (in)equality operators

parser              Monadic parser combinators.  A bit of a mess, but
                       they work.  This program inspired Brian to implement
                       monads/lambda, but he never went back to clean up
                       the program much after lambda/monads were implemented.
