To my committee,

At long last, here is my completed dissertation.  As usual, I have 
posted it at
    http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/BriDiss/
The remaining portions (basically Section 4.2 and Chapter 6) have been
completed, and I have made a number of small improvements scattered
about Chapters 2 and 3.

This week I'll be proofing the final additions and also working through
a list of actionable comments that Yannis has already given me.

This is your last chance to make comments or suggest changes.  On July
12 (next Monday) the document must be turned in.

I'll need to get signatures from you-all this week.  Let me know what
days/times are convenient for me to stop by.  (I will ask Yannis to
withhold his signature until next Monday, so that if you wish, you can
sign the form but withhold your final approval until you've had a
chance to make final comments regarding the document.)  If you will not
be available to sign in person this week, please let me know.  (Philip,
I shall mail you instructions about signing shortly.)

Thanks so much for all of your support!
   Brian
