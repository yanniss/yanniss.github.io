To my committee,

Here's an update on my dissertation.  As usual, I have posted the update at
    http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/BriDiss/
Chapters 1 and 2 were already complete; now Chapters 3 and 5 are too
(except for one subsection; see below).

When the final document is ready and meets your approval, you-all only
need to sign a single form ("Certificate of Thesis Approval").  I will
contact you-all regarding this document during the first week of July
(recall that I am out of town for the rest of this month).

DISSERTATION CHANGES: DETAILS

There are a number of minor changes throughout chapter 3 (based on
proofreading and feedback from you-all), and a couple of newly written
sections.  Now all but one subsection of that chapter is finished.

Chapter 5 has been added; a bit of that material was lifted from my
proposal, but I also rewrote portions of it and moved some of the FC++
related work out of Chapter 2 and into Chapter 5 where it seemed to fit
better.

REMAINING WORK

There are few subsections in Chapter 4, one in Chapter 3, and Chapter 6
(Conclusions) to finish writing.  I intend to finish this by the end of
the month.

OTHER MISCELLANY

In just the past week, I've received a emails from two different people
inquiring about using both FC++ and LC++ for various projects they are
working on.  I am happy to see that there continue to be new
"customers" for our libraries.

That's all for now.  Thanks for reading,
   Brian
