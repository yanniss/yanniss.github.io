Subject: [boost] Announcement: Upcoming formal review of FC++ 

The formal review of fcpp by Brian McNamara and Yannis Smaragdakis
will commence on Friday February 13th at 12 noon, PST and and run to
Monday, February 23rd, 12 noon PST.

The library is currently available at
   <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/</a>


Here is a brief introduction to the library:

   FC++ is a library for doing functional programming in C++. The
   library provides a general framework to support various functional
   programming aspects, such as higher-order polymorphic functions,
   currying, lazy evaluation, and lambda. In addition to the framework,
   FC++ also provides a large library of useful functions and data
   types.

   The main utility of the library comes from its ability to implement
   functional programming designs, especially those which use
   higher-order polymorphic functions or lazy evaluation in significant
   ways.  The library also contains a number of ancillary components
   that implement features like currying and lambda for function
   objects; these features are also useful in their own right.

For information about submitting a Formal Review, see
   <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/formal_review_process.htm">http://www.boost.org/more/formal_review_process.htm</a>

Please try out the library so that you will be prepared to
say whether or not you think the library should be accepted by
Boost during the upcoming review period next week and why.


Compiler notes:

This library has been tested with icc7 and with gcc-3.1.1 (and various
other gcc-3.x.y versions) on Solaris and Linux.

The library is also likely to compile on VC++7.1 and Comeau (prior
versions of the library succeeded with these compilers, but this
particular snapshot has not been tested with them).

The library covers a great deal of the C++ language and thus requires
a high degree of standard conformance; compilers like gcc-2.95.x and
VC++6 will not be able to compile the library.


Getting started:

The web page
   <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/</a>
mentions all the basics:
   The zip file will expand into these subdirectories:
      fcpp/fcpp/               # the library (.hpp) files
      fcpp/fcpp_clients/       # the example (.cpp) files
   Running the examples just involves invoking the complier with the
   right #include paths; for example,
      # in the fcpp_clients directory
      g++  -I/path/to/boost  -I../fcpp  some_example.cpp

There is also a gnu-style Makefile included with the clients (examples),
which will compile all of the examples in batch (you will have to edit a
tiny bit at the top of the Makefile).

The examples in the clients directory are a mix of both
(regression-type) tests cases which cover the features of the library
and example applications which demonstrate some of the library's
utility.  The README file in the client directory gives a short
explanation of some of the more interesting clients.

The documentation at
   <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/boostpaper/</a>
provides a walkthrough and reference for most of the main features of
the library.  There are also some pointers out to other papers and
documentation on the main FC++ web site:
   <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/">http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/</a>


Conformance to Boost guidelines:

The library meets most of the requirements described at
   <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm">http://www.boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm</a>
Here are a few notable exceptions:
 - the current library headers are too "monolithic"; you #include
   "prelude.hpp" and suck in all of the library
 - some of the lambda internals should be rewritten to use MPL rather
   than hand-rolled metaprogramming code
 - only a few of the example programs utilize the Boost testing
   framework (to automate regression testing)
Should the library be accepted into Boost, Brian will remedy these
deficiencies.  (If you notice other major problems along these lines,
please bring them to Brian's attention during the review.)
