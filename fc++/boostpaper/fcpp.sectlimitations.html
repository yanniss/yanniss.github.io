In this section, we discuss the limitations of the library (and address
some common questions people ask about the library), and also talk
about future directions.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id271456"></a>16.1. Limitations</h3></div></div><p>
The most obvious limitations have already been mentioned: functoids in
FC++ are only supported for up to three arguments, and functoid
parameters always have value semantics.  In practice so far, the
three-argument limit has not been an issue.  There are no technical
reasons that the framework cannot be extended to accomodate additional
arguments if this is deemed valuable.
</p><p>
The choice of &quot;value semantics&quot; arguably requires some
justification.  Most functional languages are &quot;by value&quot;, and indeed
in many functional languages, most (if not all) objects are immutable,
which makes reference semantics unnecessary.  While reference
parameters for functoids could be supported by FC++, these would
complicate the implementation and provide no extra utility within FC++
(due to the absence of lvalues).  Unfortunately, the choice of &quot;value
semantics&quot; sometimes makes it hard to interface FC++ to extant C++
code that utilizes references.  Simply put, FC++ was not designed with
cases like these in mind, and thus (like all tools) FC++ is not the
best tool for every job.
</p><p>
Functional programmers who desire a more technical discussion of the
limitations of FC++ compared to functional programming languages and
type systems should read Section 8 of [<a href="fcpp.html#fcpp.citjfp" title="[McN&amp;Sma to appear]">McN&amp;Sma to appear</a>].  It
should also be noted that FC++ provides no support for the creation of
algebraic datatypes or for pattern matching.
</p><p>
FC++ also does not provide any kind of &quot;tuple&quot; datatype.  The
commonest case, 2-tuples, are adequately met by
<tt>std::pair</tt>.  Users wanting a more general tupling mechanism
should use <tt>boost::tuple</tt>s.
</p><p>
As mentioned in <a href="fcpp.sectperformance.html#fcpp.sectperformance" title="15. Performance">Section 15</a>, the &quot;lambda&quot; and
&quot;monad&quot; portions of the library use expression templates, which can
seriously degrade compile-time performance.  Clients which make heavy
use of lambda and monads take a long time to compile and require a lot
of memory.  Hopefully, in time, C++ compilers will get better at
compiling expression-template code.
</p><p>
Finally, this document could use some improvement.  Two things are 
notably absent: some medium-sized examples demonstrating the utility of 
the library, and an initial motivating example.  One of the challenges
of presenting such examples well is choosing the application
domain&#8212;as described in <a href="fcpp.sectapplications.html#fcpp.sectapplications" title="14. Applications">Section 14</a>,
FC++ can be applied to a variety of domains.  (If you have suggestions
for improvement here, please let Brian know.)
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id271591"></a>16.2. Future work</h3></div></div><p>
Over time, the FC++ library has grown and evolved a lot in order to 
meet the needs of its users.  Though we consider the bulk of the
implementation infrastructure complete, there are still a number of
interesting future directions to consider.  These include
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li> Adding more features from Haskell, such as functions like
   <tt>seq</tt> or datatypes like <tt>Either</tt>.
</li><li> Providing a more general monadic interface to C++ containers 
   or effects
</li><li> Providing &quot;policy&quot; support for memory management
</li><li> Use <tt>boost::mpl</tt> in the
   implementation
</li></ul></div>
We also have plans to build a monadic parser combinator library (a la
<a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/papers/parsec.html" target="_top">Parsec</a>)
client atop FC++.
</p><p>
By all means, if you have feature requests for FC++, contact the
authors&#8212;especially in cases where you already have a real client
application which demonstrates the need.
