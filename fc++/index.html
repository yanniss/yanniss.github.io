<h2> FC++: Functional Programming in C++</h2>
  
<h3> Higher-Order Polymorphic Functions in the C++ Language</h3>
 FC++ is a library for functional programming in C++. Functional programming 
is a programming paradigm in which functions are treated as regular values. 
Thus, we can have functions that take other functions as parameters. The former
functions are called "higher-order" functions. A common feature of functions
is that they can be <i>polymorphic</i>. "Polymorphic" means that the same
function can be used with arguments of many types. FC++ is distinguished
from other libraries (including the C++ Standard Library) by its complete
support for polymorphism: FC++ polymorphic higher-order functions can take
other polymorphic functions as arguments and return polymorphic functions
as results. This is particularly useful (i.e., simplifies code) in C++ where
type inference is limited and we often need to pass polymorphic functions
around and determine their type later. 
<p>With FC++ you can define your own higher-order polymorphic functions, but
the library also contains a large amount of functionality that can be re-used
as-is in C++ programs. This includes infinite ("lazy") lists, useful higher-order
functions (like <tt>map</tt>, <tt>compose</tt>, etc.), a reference-counting
facility that can be used to replace C++ pointers, many common logical and
arithmetic operators in a form that can be used with higher-order functions,
and more.&nbsp; </p>

Programming in C++ using the FC++ Library</a>: a short article introducing 
FC++ (in April 2001 <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/sigplan/">SIGPLAN Notices</a>).

in the 2000 International Conference on Functional Programming (<a

understanding some of the ideas behind the implementation of FC++. <b>Important
note</b>: the actual syntax and names of some operators have changed slightly
since the version of FC++ described in this paper. For up-to-date concrete
