<h2>
FC++: Functional Programming in C++</h2>

<h3>
Higher-Order Polymorphic Functions in the C++ Language</h3>
FC++ is a library for functional programming in C++. Functional programming
is a programming paradigm in which functions are treated as regular values.
Thus, we can have functions that take other functions as parameters. The
former functions are called "higher-order" functions. A common feature
of functions is that they can be <i>polymorphic</i>. "Polymorphic" means
that the same function can be used with arguments of many types. FC++ is
distinguished from other libraries (including the C++ Standard Library)
by its complete support for polymorphism: FC++ polymorphic higher-order
functions can take other polymorphic functions as arguments and return
polymorphic functions as results. This is particularly useful (i.e., simplifies
code) in C++ where type inference is limited and we often need to pass
polymorphic functions around and determine their type later.
<p>With FC++ you can define your own higher-order polymorphic functions,
but the library also contains a large amount of functionality that can
be re-used as-is in C++ programs. This includes infinite ("lazy") lists,
useful higher-order functions (like <code>map</code>,
<code>compose</code>, etc.), a reference-counting
facility that can be used to replace C++ pointers, many common logical
and arithmetic operators in a form that can be used with higher-order functions,
and more.&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/fc++-sigplan.pdf">Functional
Programming in C++ using the FC++ Library</a>: a short article introducing
FC++ (in April 2001 <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/sigplan/">SIGPLAN 
Notices</a>). This is a good introduction to the library.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/fc++.main.pdf">Functional
Programming in C++</a>: the original research paper describing FC++. Presented
in the 2000 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2000).
Great for understanding some of the ideas behind the implementation of
FC++. <b>Important note</b>: the actual syntax and names of some operators
have changed slightly since the version of FC++ described in this paper.
For up-to-date concrete technical information, use the "Getting Started
with FC++" tutorial, below.</li>

<a href="fcpptw.pdf">Functional Programming with the FC++
Library</a>: a paper that introduces FC++ and analyzes the library
performance.  The first half of this paper is quite similar to the
SIGPLAN Notices paper above, except that this paper is aimed at the C++
audience, rather than the FP audience; the second half of the paper
(performance analysis) is new material.  (Submitted to the <a
