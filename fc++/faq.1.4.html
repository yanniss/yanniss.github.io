<hr><a NAME="faq0"></a>[0] Why is FC++ necessary when we have function
pointers?
<p>There are two key reasons and one minor reason why FC++ is better than
using function pointers for implementing higher-order functions in C++.
First, function pointers are monomorphic--you cannot create a pointer to
a polymorphic (template) function. (You can create a pointer to one of
its monomorphic instances, but you lose the polymorphic power in doing
so.) FC++ can pass polymorphic functions as parameters. Second, function
pointers can only point to functions that explicitly appear in the code.
For instance, one cannot create a function pointer to a function created
by specializing another function. Finally, function pointers add a layer
of run-time indirection that can slow down your program by hindering optimizations
like inlining. FC++ uses member function templates so even higher-order
instantiations can be inlined.&nbsp;
<hr><a NAME="faq1"></a>[1] How does FC++ compare to the "functional" part
of the C++ Standard Library?
<p>"Functoids" in FC++ are similar to "Adaptable N-ary Functions" in the
STL, in that they use nested typedefs to encode argument and result types
to enable composition of higher-order functions. The key difference is
that the STL's "Adaptables" are all monomorphic. For instance, you can
pass <tt>plus&lt;int>()</tt> as an argument to many STL functions, but
you must fix the argument type (<tt>int</tt> in this example). With FC++,
you can just pass
<tt>Plus()</tt> to a polymorphic higher-order function,
and have the argument types be deduced later/elsewhere.&nbsp;
<hr><a NAME="faq2"></a>[2] What compiler can I use for FC++?
<p>Any conformant C++ compiler should work; see the <a
href="New/compilers.html">compiler page</a> for details.
<hr><a NAME="faq3"></a>[3] Will FC++ make my programs slower?
<p>Probably not.  In principle,
if you need to use a functional idiom in your program, FC++ is one of the
most efficient ways to do it.  Sections 4 and 5 of the paper
<a href="fcpptw.pdf">Functional Programming with the FC++ Library</a> 
contain an analysis of the run-time performance of the library.
<hr><a NAME="faq4"></a>[4] What would functional programming in C++ be
good for?
<p>A lot of programming patterns could be written more concisely with FC++.
An example would be <i>lazy</i> data structures (where the members of the
structure are not evaluated until needed). Another example would be type-safe
<i>callbacks</i>:
the Observer design pattern essentially implements callbacks in an object-oriented
way, but with functional idioms the same can be done more cleanly. Finally,
function specialization is very straightforward so new functions can be
created from fixing some arguments of old ones.  The paper <a
href="funoo.pdf">FC++: Functional Tools for OO Tasks</a> describes how
FC++ can be used in the implementation of design patterns.
<p>
<hr><a NAME="faq5"></a>[5] What does <tt>take (5, map (odd, enumFrom(1)))</tt>
mean?
<p>The functions named above are all part of Haskell's standard library
(called the Standard Prelude). <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
is a modern pure functional programming language, and much of the functionality
of FC++ mimics Haskell exactly. This is meant to make FC++ more accessible
to the "functional programming crowd" who may be less familiar with C++.
<p>In this example, <tt>enumFrom(1)</tt> creates an infinite list of integers
(1, 2, 3, ...), <tt>odd</tt> is a function which returns true if its argument
is odd, <tt>map</tt> works like
<tt>MAPCAR</tt> in LISP by applying its
argument to each element of a list, and <tt>take</tt> selects the first
N elements of a list. As a result, the expression above resolves to the
list (true, false, true, false, true).
<p>For documentation of the meaning of the FC++ functoids defined in
<tt>prelude.h</tt>,
you should check out the <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html">documentation
of the corresponding Haskell functions</a> (see section "A.1" that starts
about half way down the page).
<br>
<hr><a NAME="faq6"></a>[6] Haven't other people done functional programming
in C++ before? How is FC++ different?
<p>FC++ is the first library to enable polymorphic higher-order functions
that have polymorphic arguments. In the past, if one wanted to express
polymorphic functions in C++, these couldn't be used as arguments to other
functions. This may seem like a detail, but it is particularly useful in
C++ because of the limited type inference capabilities of the language.
For instance, consider the standard FC++ example:
<br><tt>&nbsp; take(5, map(odd, enumFrom(1)))</tt> .
<br>Without the ability to have polymorphic functions that take other polymorphic
functions as arguments, <tt>odd</tt> would have to be monomorphic (i.e.,
it would lose in generality). With FC++ we have a fully general definition
of <tt>odd</tt>, pass it to <tt>map</tt> and let map determine its required
type later. An even better example is:
<br><tt>&nbsp; compose(tail, tail).</tt>
<br>The above composition is a polymorphic function (assuming that <tt>tail</tt>
is also polymorphic). No C++ library before FC++ supported something similar.
<p>FC++ also offers several expressiveness and performance enhancements
over older libraries for functional programming in C++. It defines a subtyping
policy for functions (so you can substitute a more general function where
a specific one is expected), it offers efficient memory management, it
defines a wealth of operators commonly found in functional languages, it
provides automatic <a href="currying.html">currying</a> of functoids, it
comes with an implementation of a lazy list data structure, and it provides
interface functions from STL function objects, C++ function pointers,
etc. to FC++ functoids.
<br>

<hr><a NAME="faq7"></a>[7] Does FC++ make C++ a functional programming
language?

<p>
That depends on your definition of "functional programming language".
The moniker "functional programming" is a wide umbrella (it encompasses 
languages as different as LISP and Haskell, for example).
Nevertheless, there are some features that seem common among functional
programming languages.  Here is one possible enumeration of features which
functional languages typically support a majority of, as well as details
of how well FC++ supports them:
<p>
Features:
<ol>
<li>referential transparency (no assignment of variables, no
side-effects)</li>
<li>higher-order functions (functions passed/returned as values)</li>
<li>lambda (ability to create anonymous functions)</li>
<li>currying (partial application)</li>
<li>polymorphism (parametric)</li>
<li>automatic memory management</li>
</ol>
FC++ support:
<ol>
<li>FC++ is embedded in C++, so there is no way we can prevent anyone
from using side-effects.  However, our library components are all
referentially transparent (by design), though there are some
side-effects used "under the hood" (not visible to the outside
world) for efficiency.</li>
<li>FC++ indirect functoids are first-class values; direct functoids are
not first-class, but can still be manipulated by higher-order functions
using the FC++ idioms.</li>
<li>FC++ has no "lambda", though some functions can be created "on the
fly" via currying (see next point).</li>
<li>FC++ has currying combinators that make functoids curryable; all the
functoids in the library support automatic currying.</li>
<li>FC++ supports parametric polymorphism through C++ templates.</li>
<li>C++ doesn't have automatic memory management (unless, for example,
you get a 
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">garbage
collector</a> for C++) but
the FC++ library (like any decent C++ library) manages its own memory,
creating no extra burden for users.</li>
</ol>
