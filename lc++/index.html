<p>
LC++ is a library for logic programming in C++.  Using LC++, C++
programmers can write declarative, Prolog-like code in their C++ 
programs.  
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
Here is a quick look at <a href="family_cc_snippet.txt">what it looks 
like to write LC++ code</a>.  Look at this short 
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> for more information about the
details.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <a href="paper.pdf">paper</a> describing the library.
</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>

<p>
You can <a href="LC++v1.0">download LC++</a> here.  
</p>

<p>
You also need to download <a
href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/">FC++</a> (v1.5) to use LC++.
Both libraries are just sets of C++ header (<code>.h</code>) files that
you need to <code>#include</code>.
</p>

<h3>Related links</h3>

<p>
LC++ is built atop the <a
href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/fc++/">FC++</a> library.
